# Discord_Bot
A discord bot made with Python that can do various things. Like grab showerthoughts from Reddit and send them, translate your messages into morse code, send funny gifs from a movie, count numbers quickly, or put a santa hat on your profile picture and send it using image processing techniques with both PIL and OpenCV. Discord bots use the event-driven programming paradigm, where specific code runs when an event happens from a user(s).
